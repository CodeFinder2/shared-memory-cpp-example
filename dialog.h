#ifndef CONSUMER_DIALOG_H
#define CONSUMER_DIALOG_H

// Abstract: this C++ application contains the consumer logic, i.e., it waits until the Python app
//           has created (aka produced) an image and put that into a shared memory segment. This app
//           then displays (aka consumes) the image. By slightly changing the code base of both app
//           the behavior can be inverted.

// (System-wide) Unique name of the shared memory; must be equal in all apps using the memory:
#define UNIQUE_SHARED_MEMORY_NAME  "MySharedMemoryDefault"
// Hardcoded file name of file to be used for specifying an alternative name of the shared memory.
// If that file exists, its first line is ALWAYS used as the shared memory's name:
#define SHARED_MEMORY_KEY_FILE     "shared_memory.key"
// (System-wide) Unique names of (system) semaphores to be used for synchronizing producer/consumer:
#define UNIQUE_SEMAPHORE_EMPTY     "MySemaphoreEmpty"
#define UNIQUE_SEMAPHORE_FULL      "MySemaphoreFull"

// If defined, the application uses a dedicated thread for (passively) wait until an image was
// produced. Uncomment to disable threading, making the app BLOCK after clicking "" until an image was produced.
