# Abstract: this Python app contains the producer logic. Upon selecting an image file to load, it
#           will be displayed in the UI and copied to the shared memory (producing). The consumer
#           can then display (= consume) it as well. Don't (try to) load another image if the
#           previous image hasn't been consumed; otherwise the app will block (until consumed). By
#           slightly changing the code base of both app the behavior can be inverted.
