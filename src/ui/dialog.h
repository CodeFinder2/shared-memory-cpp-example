#ifndef CONSUMER_DIALOG_H
#define CONSUMER_DIALOG_H

// Abstract: this C++ application contains the consumer logic, i.e., it waits until the Python app
//           has created (aka produced) an image and put that into a shared memory segment. This app
//           then displays (aka consumes) the image. By changing CONSUMER in the code base of both
//           apps, the behavior can be inverted. It surely also works when using only C++ or only
//           only Python apps (one consumer, one producer of course).

#define CONSUMER 1 // 1: this is the consumer, 0: this is the producer

// (System-wide) Unique name of the shared memory; must be equal in all apps using the memory:
#define UNIQUE_SHARED_MEMORY_NAME  "MySharedMemoryDefault"
// Hardcoded file name of file to be used for specifying an alternative name of the shared memory.
// If that file exists, its first line is ALWAYS used as the shared memory's name:
#define SHARED_MEMORY_KEY_FILE     "shared_memory.key"

// Enable or disable sharing a format-specified struct between Python and C++, see
//  - https://github.com/karkason/cppystruct
//  - https://docs.python.org/2/library/struct.html
// (Only works if this is the consumer.)
#define SHARED_STRUCT
// Format of data to be shared: datatype (type, size) and order, see
// https://docs.python.org/2/library/struct.html#format-characters
