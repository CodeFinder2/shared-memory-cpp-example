/**
 * \class ProducerIPC
 * \brief Provides simplified access to shared memory as a "producer"
 *
 * Given a system-wide producer-consumer problem, this class encapsulates the
 * Inter-Process-Communication (IPC) for the producer. It allows simplified access to the underlying
 * shared memory.
 *
 * Basically, to put data into the shared memory, call \c begin() with the amount of memory your
 * data needs. A pointer to the allocated shared memory is then provided in \c data. Afterwards,
 * call end to complete the transaction. Alternatively, use \c ScopedProducer for a even simpler
 * use.
 *
 * \todo add a signal `void consumed()` to allow using this class asynchronously but keep this sync
 *       variant since in most cases, "production" requires more time is done in a dedicated thread
 *       anyway so blocking that thread isn't a problem (and often desired)
