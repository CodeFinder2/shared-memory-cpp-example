    Given a system-wide producer-consumer problem, this class encapsulates the Inter-Process-Communication (IPC) for the
    producer. It allows simplified access to the underlying shared memory.

    Basically, to put data into the shared memory, call `begin()` with the amount of memory your data needs. You can
    then store the data under the provided `data` attribute. Afterwards, call `end()` to complete the transaction.
